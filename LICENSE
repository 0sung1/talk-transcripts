I have no authority to grant a license of any kind
for this content. I just think that the valuable and 
relevant content in these talks should be accessible 
to anyone, including those for whom 'sit back and 
listen' might not be the most viable option.

Obviously, if you are the copyright owner and you 
object to making this content more accessible for free,
you should let me know and I will take the transcript 
that is in violation of anything down. To be honest, 
I would much prefer receiving an explicit permission 
for this purpose. 

Thanks! Matthias
