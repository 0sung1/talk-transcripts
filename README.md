talk-transcripts
================
For my last article, I listened to Rich Hickey's talk about Transducers a couple of times, and every single time I discovered something new. That made me wonder about my perception. After thinking about it for a little while, I noticed a pattern. For me, talks are pretty much always either to fast or too slow at any given point in time. The reason for that is that either something is all new and background information is mentioned that I would want to read about first, or I know what is being talked about already. The danger for me mostly lies in the latter. I tend to relatively easily drift off into other thoughts and distractions, particularly when watching a recording of a talk instead of being in the audience. But then these other thoughts and activities tend to be so engaging that I miss crucial information in the talk itself.

There's really not a lot one could do about that on the side of the presenter. The audience will always be in one of the modes described above unless everything is already known. And given that each member of an audience has different knowledge sweetspots, there is not a lot to optimize. 

But there's one thing that would help me immensely: a full transcript of the talk. With that, I'd watch the talk once and then mark the sections I want to read up upon in the transcript, probably with a good old marker. That way, it should be next to impossibly to miss anything crucial. At least for me, my marker hardly ever misses anything, and whenever thoughts go elsewhere, it is very easy to note my last position in the document and go back to this position later.

Unfortunately, though, transcripts of talks that I could print usually just aren't there. Which makes me wonder what you do when you're a software engineer AND deaf. Particularly for the Transducers talk, there was plenty of information in there that I hadn't seen elsewhere. I don't think we as a community should exclude people just because of their hearing capability. In other words, I think these transcripts really should exists.

Now, I like solutions rather than problems so I hired someone on a freelance basis to transcribe the first talk for me, which you find in this repository. I intend to do the same for more articles to come. Let me know on Twitter if you think this is a good idea: **[@matthiasnehlsen](https://twitter.com/matthiasnehlsen)**
